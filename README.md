This project involves recreating the Google homepage to the best of my ability. It was an enlightening experience as it was my first build. I learned how to create an HTML and a CSS document to formulate and style a webpage. This included organizing elements and using design techniques to shape the look of the page. I also learned to push my work onto Github throughout the project.
